== Attribute requirements in the ICD Schema

Each ICD event attribute is either Required, Recommended or Optional:

[cols="a,a", options="header,unnumbered"]
|===
| Attributes requirements | Description

| Required attributes
| ensure that the event data is minimally normalized to the Integrated
Cyber Defense Schema.

All products should supply the required attributes with each event.

If a required attribute is not provided, the collector supplies a
default value.

| Recommended attributes
| provide an improved view to cross-product data and allow for meaningful
correlation.

If the recommended information is available within the product, it
must be supplied.

If a recommended attribute is not provided, the attribute must not
be included (null values are not a allowed).

| Optional attributes
| provide detailed event information. One or more products may supply
optional attributes.
