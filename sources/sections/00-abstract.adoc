This document is the 2nd Revised baseline text for X.icd-schemas:
Vendor agnostic Security Data Schemas for Integrated Cyber Defense
Solutions

Contribution C104 was accepted with additional remarks

* Contributor missed to keep the revision mark vs 1st Revised text
* In clause 10 there are trademarks names
* In Conventions there is the missing normative statements now added
* Interest from Quantum community to use and potentially add new dictionary
elements

Editors note too that the title of this draft Recommendation was changed
in the 1st Revised baseline but this was not reflected in the work
program of Q15.
