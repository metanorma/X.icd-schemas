== Overview of the ICD Schema

Characteristics of the ICD Schema

* Event types

EDITOR: need to find a good definition here.

* Event types can be organized in categories
* Each event type has required, recommended and optional attributes
* All event types include a set of common attributes
* Attributes can be strings, numbers, enumerations or objects
* Attributes that are enumerations are constrained to subsets within
different event types
* Attributes are organized into groups for convenience

NOTE: Products that are event sources can emit events across categories
and event types
