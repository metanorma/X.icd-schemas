EDITOR: find a normative reference perhaps in W3C?

=== Terms defined in this Recommendation

EDITOR: We should consider to bring ALL the event terms and attributes
here so that they can be used and referred to by other Recommendations
and normative work elsewhere, in particular as to potential alignment
with OASIS OpenC2.

An initiative for interoperability of security products, technologies
and services.
