== Conventions

In this Recommendation:

The phrase "is required" indicates a requirement that must be strictly
followed and from which no deviation is permitted if conformance to
this document is to be claimed.

The phrase "is recommended" indicates a requirement that is recommended,
but which is not absolutely required. Thus, this requirement need
not be present to claim conformance.

In this Recommendation, the keywords "shall" and "should" may sometimes
appear, in which case they are to be interpreted as "`is required
to`" and "`is recommended`" respectively.
